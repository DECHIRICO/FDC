    .row
      .nine.columns
        p When I joined, the company wanted to focus more on the marketers. The previous approach of creating an Agency&Client login needed to be simplified for these new users but in the meantime it still needed to address the existing and new users that were looking for Agency one. My job was to create a simple login screen that could capture both scenarios.

          p As I joined Camaign Monitor, the company decided to change its direction to focus more attention on the marketers. The challenge was to simplify the creation of new accounts for these new users (Marketers Direct) but in the meantime still addressing the existing that were looking for previous version (Agencies and Clients). My job was to create a simple solution that could capture both scenarios.

          p As part of the same project I designed a new header for the Marketers Direct. The aim was to simplify the overall navigation creating a new header reducing the UI to the essential. On the back of this I had been working on few illustrations and icon designs for the section "Account Settings".
